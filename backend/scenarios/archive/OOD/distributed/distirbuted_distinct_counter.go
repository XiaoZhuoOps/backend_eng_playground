# 1. Detailed Design Document

## 1.1 Overview and Motivation

Distinct counting (i.e., counting unique elements in a dataset) is critical in many large-scale distributed environments. Typical use cases include:
- Counting unique website visitors across multiple servers.
- Tracking distinct IP addresses in network traffic analysis.
- Identifying unique query patterns or unique user IDs in large-scale database or log analytics.

However, designing distinct counters for distributed systems brings unique challenges, including:
- **Data partitioning** and load balancing.
- **Network latency** influencing communication between partitions.
- **Fault tolerance** and handling node failures gracefully.
- **Consistency** trade-offs in eventually-consistent vs. strongly-consistent models.

This design document delves into multiple distinct counting data structures and algorithms, each with unique advantages and drawbacks in terms of memory usage, accuracy, and performance. We then integrate these into a distributed architecture with consistent hashing, replication, and concurrency control.  

## 1.2 Algorithms and Data Structures

We will consider five major approaches:

1. **Map-based Counter**  
   - **Mechanism**: Stores each distinct element in a hash map or distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis, Cassandra).  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Exact counting (100% accuracy).  
     - Familiar to most engineers.  
     - Straightforward to implement.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Potentially high memory usage for very large cardinalities.  
     - Possibly slower membership checks at scale, depending on the underlying store’s performance.  
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Small- to medium-scale scenarios requiring exact counts.

2. **Bitmap**  
   - **Mechanism**: Represents each possible element by an index in a large bit array; the index is set to `1` when the element appears.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Exact counting (no collisions if element space can be mapped effectively).  
     - Very fast set membership checks and union/aggregation operations.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires large contiguous memory if the element domain is huge (e.g., billions of IDs).  
     - Not flexible if domain is unbounded or extremely large.  
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Use cases where the domain is known and reasonably bounded (e.g., user IDs in a controlled system, sensor IDs in an IoT environment).

3. **Roaring Bitmap**  
   - **Mechanism**: A more space-efficient version of bitmaps that chunks the bit array into blocks (containers) and compresses them differently depending on data density.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Efficient compression for both sparse and dense data.  
     - Faster performance than naive bitmap in many real-world scenarios.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Still not suitable for unbounded or massive (10^9+) domains unless carefully managed or partitioned.  
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Large but somewhat sparse data (e.g., user IDs with some known maximum, but usage may be sparse).

4. **HyperLogLog (HLL)**  
   - **Mechanism**: A probabilistic data structure that uses hashing and “buckets” (registers) to estimate cardinality. Merging two HLL sketches is straightforward by taking the maximum register values across the sketches.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Very memory-efficient (kilobytes vs. gigabytes in other exact structures).  
     - Mergeable in a distributed setting (simple max operation on registers).  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Provides an approximate count with a fixed error margin (commonly around 2% standard error).  
     - Implementation details (e.g., bias correction) can be tricky.  
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Large-scale analytics (page views, clickstreams) where an approximate count is acceptable and memory footprint is critical.

5. **Bloom Filter** (with a note on counting distinct elements)  
   - **Mechanism**: A probabilistic data structure for membership queries. Bloom Filters cannot directly count distinct elements but can be used as a **pre-filter** to reduce the volume of candidate elements passed on to a more precise or approximate counter.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Very memory-efficient for membership testing.  
     - Low false-negative rate (zero if implemented carefully) but has a controlled false-positive rate.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Cannot directly yield a distinct count.  
     - False positives may inflate any subsequent counting data structure.  
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Pre-filtering to reduce load on a more accurate counting structure like a Map-based Counter or HLL.

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Bloom Filter + HLL**: Filter out duplicates early, then feed probable unique elements into HLL. Reduces register updates.  
- **Adaptive Algorithm**: Switch from Map-based to HLL when cardinalities become large enough to make memory usage or response times with the Map-based approach prohibitive.

## 1.3 Distributed Architecture

### 1.3.1 Data Partitioning

We use **consistent hashing** or a shard-based approach to distribute elements across multiple nodes. Each node maintains its local distinct counter instance (e.g., a local HLL or local bitmap).  

On insertion of an element `e`, the system:
1. Hashes `e` to determine which node(s) should receive and store it.  
2. Sends `e` to the responsible node(s).  
3. The node updates its local data structure (e.g., sets a bit in a bitmap, updates HLL registers, etc.).

### 1.3.2 Synchronization and Consistency

- **Eventual Consistency**: If real-time global accuracy is not critical, we can rely on eventual consistency. Nodes periodically merge sketches or states.  
- **CRDTs** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): HLL can be modeled as a CRDT, making merges commutative and idempotent.  
- **Distributed Transactions**: For Map-based counters, transactions (or strong consistency) may be needed to ensure no double counting—this can become expensive as the system scales.

### 1.3.3 Fault Tolerance

- **Replication**: Each node’s data structure is replicated to one or more backup nodes or data stores.  
- **Recovery**: On node failure, a backup node or set of logs can reconstruct the local counters.  
- **Durability**: Persistent storage (e.g., Cassandra, Kafka logs) can store incremental snapshots or logs of updates.

### 1.3.4 Querying and Aggregation

- **Local Queries**: Retrieve the approximate or exact count from one node.  
- **Global Queries**: Merge the partial results from each node. For HLL, merges are done by taking the register-wise maximum. For bitmaps, merges are bitwise OR. For a map-based counter, merges require set union (or distributed set union).  

## 1.4 Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**:  
   - Map-based counters can become huge at scale.  
   - Bitmap-based counters can be large if the domain is wide.  
   - HLL is compact.  
2. **Query Latency**:  
   - Map-based queries involve cardinality computation (often trivial if the size is maintained incrementally).  
   - Bitmaps are very fast to query if a running count is maintained, or if quickly counting set bits is feasible.  
   - HLL queries are nearly instant (just read the registers and compute the estimate).  
3. **Update Latency**:  
   - Map-based: O(log n) or O(1) average for hash set insertion.  
   - Bitmap-based: O(1) to set a bit.  
   - HLL-based: O(1) to update the relevant register.  
4. **Accuracy**:  
   - Map-based/bitmaps: Exact.  
   - HLL: Probabilistic (2% error typical).  
   - Bloom Filter: For membership tests only; false positives can degrade accuracy if used alone.  

## 1.5 Recommendations and Trade-Offs

- **Small to medium cardinalities**: Map-based or roaring bitmaps provide exactness with reasonable memory overhead.  
- **Large cardinalities**: HLL is strongly recommended for memory efficiency.  
- **Hybrid**: Use Bloom filters to pre-filter + HLL if high throughput is needed and the domain is huge.

# 2. Go Implementation

Below is an illustrative, simplified package `distributed_distinct_counter` in Go. It provides interfaces for each distinct counter type (map-based, bitmap/roaring, HLL, Bloom filter), as well as a top-level manager for distributing these counters across multiple nodes.

> **Note**: This code is deliberately simplified to highlight core concepts. In a production system, you would add:  
> - Thread-safety (via mutexes or atomic variables).  
> - More robust error handling.  
> - Networking/ RPC/ gRPC for inter-node communication.  
> - Persistent storage or snapshotting.

### Notable Implementation Points
1. **Concurrency**:  
   - Each data structure uses `sync.Mutex` for internal concurrency control.  
   - The `DistributedManager` uses `sync.RWMutex` to allow concurrent reads.
2. **Merging**:  
   - For each data structure, the `Merge` method is carefully defined.  
   - HLL merges by taking the maximum register values.  
   - Bitmaps merge by bitwise OR.  
   - Map-based merges by union of keys.  
3. **Scaling**:  
   - In a real production environment, distribution would occur over a cluster via gRPC or a message bus.  
   - Replication and snapshotting are not shown here but would be critical for fault tolerance.

# 3. Performance Evaluation Report

## 3.1 Experimental Setup

1. **Cluster Configuration**:  
   - 3 to 5 nodes on commodity servers (e.g., 4 cores, 8 GB RAM).  
   - Each node runs one distinct counter instance.

2. **Workload**:  
   - We vary the number of unique elements from 10^4 to 10^8.  
   - Distribution of elements:  
     - **Uniform**: each element is equally likely.  
     - **Zipfian/Skewed**: certain elements appear more frequently.

3. **Metrics**:
   - **Memory Usage**: Byte usage of the data structure at each node.  
   - **Update Latency**: Time to process an “Add” operation.  
   - **Query Latency**: Time to compute a global distinct count.  
   - **Accuracy**: For approximate structures (HLL), the relative error from the true distinct count.

4. **Implementation**:
   - The code above can be extended to run performance benchmarks using `testing.B` or frameworks like `golang.org/x/perf`.

## 3.2 Illustrative Results (Hypothetical)

| Data Structure      | Distinct N=10^6 | Distinct N=10^7 | Memory Usage (MB) | Accuracy  | Update Latency (ns) | Global Query (ms) |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Map-Based           | 1,000,000       | 10,000,000      | High (500–2,000)  | Exact     | ~1,000–5,000        | 50–100            |
| Bitmap (1 bit/elem) | 1,000,000       | 10,000,000      | Medium (125–1,250)| Exact     | ~100–500            | 20–60             |
| Roaring Bitmap      | 1,000,000       | 10,000,000      | Lower than naive bitmap   | Exact     | ~200–500            | 20–60             |
| HyperLogLog (p=14)  | ~1,000,500      | ~9,800,000      | Very Low (<10)    | ~2% error | ~100–200            | 10–30             |

Notes:
- **Memory Usage** in MB is approximate and depends on factors such as system architecture, load factor, implementation overheads, etc.  
- **Accuracy** for HLL is typically around 2% for p=14.  
- **Update Latency** can vary widely based on concurrency and the underlying system details.

## 3.3 Observations
- Map-based counters, while exact, become infeasible beyond tens of millions of keys due to enormous memory overhead.  
- Bitmap solutions provide exactness but require knowledge or bounding of the ID space. Roaring bitmaps significantly reduce storage when data is sparse or semi-sparse.  
- HyperLogLog stands out for memory efficiency and fast merges, making it especially suitable for large-scale distributed systems where slight approximation is acceptable.  
- Combining Bloom filters as a pre-filter can reduce load on the subsequent data structure (e.g., the global HLL), especially when the input stream has many repeated elements.

## 3.4 Recommendations
- For an environment with extremely large cardinalities:  
  - **HyperLogLog** is the practical first choice for a distributed setting.  
  - Consider a Bloom Filter + HLL hybrid if you suspect massive repeated elements.  
- For moderate cardinalities or if exactness is essential:  
  - **Map-based** or **Roaring Bitmap**, possibly partitioned among nodes to avoid memory blow-up.

## Conclusion

We have presented:

- **Detailed Design**: Covering fundamental trade-offs for distinct counting in distributed systems, with emphasis on data partitioning, fault tolerance, and concurrency.  
- **Go Implementation**: A prototype that demonstrates the essential logic for five approaches: Map-based, Bitmap, Roaring Bitmap, HyperLogLog, and Bloom Filter (as a pre-filter). A distributed manager orchestrates these counters across multiple nodes.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Illustrates how each data structure performs under varying loads and cardinalities, highlighting the importance of balancing memory usage, accuracy requirements, and performance overhead.

By combining these techniques—and possibly employing hybrid or adaptive strategies—engineers can design robust, scalable, and efficient distributed distinct counters tailored to specific application workloads and accuracy needs.
